Install rpi-images:
Followed instructions from here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
Downloaded rpi-installer deb package for Ubuntu here:
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_1.4_amd64.deb
sudo apt install qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-templates2
sudo apt --fix-broken install # Don't know why this was required
sudo dpkg -i Downloads/qrcp_0.6.4_linux_x86_64.deb

Found only 32-bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS inside rpi-imager.
Wanter 64-bit.
Why insist on 64-bit? Faster. Source:

It turns out they're already working on the 64-bit version I want.
Downloaded beta from Aug 2020:

Issues for the beta are collected here:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-OS-64bit/issues

Issue:
None of MMAL (on which raspivid/still and Picamera rely) is currently working on 64 bit builds.
V4L2 is working.
https://github.com/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-OS-64bit/issues/10

So we must use the 32-bit until the 64-bit has MMAL working...
I will use the recommended one from rpi-imager.
